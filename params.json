It maintains the folder structure \r\nin which the config files are stored, so the backups can be simply \r\nmerged into a new instance of the same project. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ability to specify output directory, source directory, or neither\r\n- Duplicates folder structure in which config files are currently \r\n  stored\r\n- Will also copy disabled config files (e.g. \"xxxxx.config.example\" or \r\n  \"xxxxx.config.disabled\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Execution\r\n\r\n\r\n### Default Settings:\r\n\r\n- The location of executable will be used as source directory to search \r\n  for and copy config files from\r\n- The output directory will be generated inside the source directory, \r\n  with the name:\r\n  > \"[source directory name]_configs\"\r\n\r\n  Note: The output directory will be uniquely named, i.e. no \r\n  directories will be overwritten\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Double-Click Execution:\r\n\r\nRunning the executable via double-click, i.e. not from the command \r\nprompt, will run ConfigCopier with the default settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command Line Execution:\r\n\r\nThe following are the valid syntaxes for calling ConfigCopier from the \r\ncommand prompt:\r\n\r\n  > ConfigCopier\r\n  \r\n  > ConfigCopier.exe       \r\n  \r\n  > ConfigCopier [output directory path] \r\n   \r\n  > ConfigCopier.exe [output directory path]  \r\n  \r\n  > ConfigCopier [output directory path] [source directory path] \r\n  \r\n  > ConfigCopier.exe [output directory path] [source directory path]\r\n  \r\n  Note: If an output path is specified and a directory at that \r\n  location already exists, it will be overwritten. This only occurs if\r\n  an output path was EXPLICITELY SPECIFIED\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis software is protected under the MIT license, below, and under the \r\nOpen Source GPL v3.0 license (http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0).\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Zachary Kniebel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a \r\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including \r\nwithout limitationthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, \r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to \r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to \r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included \r\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS \r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF \r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. \r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY \r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, \r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE \r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
